Welcome to my weather website, where you can stay up-to-date on the latest weather conditions in your area! Built using NPM and Webpack, I've optimized the site for fast loading times and a smooth user experience. I have used the OpenWeather API to provide accurate and reliable weather information. Whether you need to plan your day or prepare for a trip, our site has got you covered.
